# Overview 

Hello! We would like you to build .NET API endpoints that perform actions on a SQL database. If you encounter any issues while working through this challenge, please be sure to share them with us or how you worked around them.

## Software Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Core 3.1
- Sql Server 2016 Developer: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/csharp/win

## Getting Started

The BuildDatabaseWithSampleData.sql script will build the database with the necessary tables with sample data.

## Technical Requirements

Create API endpoints that return all columns that do the following:

* List all courses for a particular student
* For a particular instructor, list all the students' grades the instructor has given out
* List all students that have the top 3 grades for each course
* Enroll a student in a course
* Update a grade(number) for a student for a course

## Bonus Requirements

Setup a postman collection that calls each one of the endpoints.
