# Overview 

Hello! We would like you to build .NET API endpoints that perform actions on a SQL database. If you encounter any issues while working through this challenge, please be sure to share them with us or how you worked around them. While we are interested in a working example it is not required to finish the complete exercise.  It is important to be able to present your example showing how you came up with your solution, good Object Oriented coding practices and a strong working knowledge of .Net.

## Software Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Core 3.1
- Sql Server 2016 Developer: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/csharp/win

## Getting Started

The BuildDatabaseWithSampleData.sql script will build the database with the necessary tables with sample data.

## Technical Requirements

Create API endpoints that return all columns that do the following:

* For a particular instructor, list all the students' grades the instructor has given out
* List all students that have the top 3 grades for each course
* Enroll a student in a course
* Update a grade(number) for a student for a course

## Stretch Goals

* Modify the databse to allow for the storage of students' historical grades.
* Setup a postman collection that calls each one of the endpoints.
